🔑 Key Elements of a Wireframe
A wireframe is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product. It focuses on structure, layout, and functionality rather than design aesthetics. Below are the essential elements found in a wireframe:

1. 📐 Layout Structure
Definition: This refers to the overall arrangement of sections on a page (e.g., header, body, sidebar, footer).

Example & Contribution:

A homepage wireframe might display a top header, followed by a main content area divided into two columns (articles and sidebar), and a footer at the bottom. This structure ensures consistency and visual hierarchy across the site.

2. 🧭 Navigation
Definition: Navigation elements help users move through the product, such as menus, links, and breadcrumbs.

Example & Contribution:

A top navigation bar with links like Home, About, Contact helps users understand where they are and how to reach different parts of the site. Wireframes place these links strategically to prioritize usability.

3. 🧩 Content Placement
Definition: Specifies where various types of content (text, images, videos) will appear on the screen.

Example & Contribution:

For a blog page, placing a title at the top, followed by a featured image, and then the body text, allows for clear reading flow. It ensures designers and developers understand where each content type belongs.

4. ⚙️ Functionality
Definition: Indicates how interactive elements like buttons, forms, sliders, or modals will behave.
